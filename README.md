# Investigate-an-IMDB-movie-dataset

The dataset we are analysing is the TMDb movie data, a quick view of the csv file with Excel shows us that the data contains about 10000 of these information: movie ID, imdb ID, popularity, budget, revenue, movie title, a list of casts, homepage url, director, tagline, keywords, overview, runtime in minutes, a list of genres, a list of production companies, release dates, vote counts, vote averages, release years and adjusted budget and revenue considering inflation over the years, in term of 2010 dollars.

From the data analysis, we drew the following conclusions:

1. There is a clear positive correlation between movie budget and revenue, the movies with a higher budget tend to perform better than those with a lower budget.

2. The data also suggests positive correlation between popularity and revenue, showing that popular movies are more profitable. There is also a positive correlation between runtime and revenue. However, with some speculation, we can say there may be not a direct cause and effect between these two because firstly, most movies are around 100 minutes, much shorter animation or student films or longer documentaries tend to target completely different audiences.

3. The average revenue shows a drop around 1978 - 1985. Except for that, there isn't an obvious correlation between publication time and revenue.

4. Drama and comedy genre are consistently the most popular genres over the decades, with Drama being the most popular except for the 1980s.
